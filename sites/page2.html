    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <header>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HyperText Markup Language</a>, or HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the standard<br>
            markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be<br>
            assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages<br>
            such as JavaScript.</p>
            <br>
        <p>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and<br>
            render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a<br>
            web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

        <p>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images<br>
            and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
            HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics<br>
            for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements<br>
            are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.<br>
            Tags such as -img-  and -input- directly introduce content into the page. Other tags<br>
            such as -p- surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags<br>
            as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the<br>
            content of the page.
